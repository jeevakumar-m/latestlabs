      <li><strong>Testing Shows Presence of Defects:</strong> The primary objective of software testing is to identify defects or bugs in the software. Testing demonstrates the existence, not the absence, of defects. It's practically impossible to prove the absence of all defects, but effective testing can significantly reduce their occurrence.</li>
      <li><strong>Exhaustive Testing is Impossible:</strong> It's impractical to test every possible input and scenario due to the sheer complexity of software systems. Therefore, instead of aiming for exhaustive testing, testers focus on risk-based testing strategies to prioritize testing efforts on critical functionalities and areas of the software.</li>
      <li><strong>Early Testing:</strong> Testing should start as early as possible in the software development lifecycle. By testing early, defects can be identified and fixed when they are less costly to address. Early testing also helps in improving overall software quality and reducing rework.</li>
      <li><strong>Defect Clustering:</strong> Experience shows that defects tend to cluster together. Certain modules or components of the software are more error-prone than others. Testers should focus their efforts on these high-risk areas to maximize defect detection.</li>
      <li><strong>Pesticide Paradox:</strong> If the same tests are repeated over and over again, eventually they become ineffective at finding new defects. To combat this, test cases need to evolve continuously to uncover new defects. Testers should regularly review and update test cases to maintain their effectiveness.</li>
      <li><strong>Testing is Context Dependent:</strong> Testing approaches, techniques, and tools vary based on the context of the software being tested. Factors such as project requirements, technology stack, domain, budget, and timeline influence testing decisions. Testers should adapt their testing strategies to fit the specific context of the project.</li>
      <li><strong>Absence-of-Errors:</strong> Though it's the ultimate goal, achieving the absence of errors in software is practically impossible. Hence, testers aim to mitigate risks associated with defects by identifying and fixing as many defects as possible through thorough testing.</li>
